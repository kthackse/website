## Clauses

### 1.Object

By virtue of this agreement, the Participant or Attendee agrees to participate in the event KTHack organized by KTHAIS, which is the first student hackathon in Sweden.

This T&C apply to both the Participants and the Attendees, although some of its clauses may only be applicable to the Participant given their role in the hackaton.

KTHAIS is an association that promotes technology, creativity and innovation and organizes events, primarily related with Artificial Intelligence and also this hackathon, which takes place once a year.

### 2.KTHack competition rules

This are KTHack competition rules. They are a customised version of the standard competition rules used at MLH member hackathons. If you have a suggestion for this rules or a question about them, please submit it to the email address provided.

#### The spirit of the competition

Remember that hackathons are like marathons. Some people go to compete but most people take part to better themselves and have fun. Whatever the reason is you're at a hackathon, make sure you're upholding the hacker spirit by collaborating with other teams, helping beginners, and having fun.

#### The rules of the competition

1. There is no minimum team size, however, the maximum size is 4 people. There will be 1 prize for each member of the team, independently of the team size.
2. Teams should be made up exclusively of students (or recent graduates within one year of having graduated) who are not organisers, judges, sponsors, or in any other privileged position at the event. Volunteers are allowed to participate in their free time, accepting the extra difficulty of hacking and volunteering at the same time, but their role won't give them any judging advantage in front of the rest of participants.
3. All team members should be present at the event. Leaving the venue for some time to hack elsewhere or sleep is fine.
4. Teams can of course gain advice and support from organisers, volunteers, sponsors, and others.
5. All work on a project should be done at the hackathon.
6. Teams can use an idea they had before the event.
7. Teams can work on ideas that have already been done. Hacks do not have to be “"innovative". If somebody wants to work on a common idea they should be allowed to do so and should be judged on the quality of their hack. These days it's hard to find something that's fully original and teams might not know an idea has been done before anyway.
8. Teams can work on an idea that they have worked on before (as long as they do not reuse code).
9. Teams can use libraries, frameworks, or open-source code in their projects. Working on a project before the event and open-sourcing it for the sole purpose of using the code during the event is against the spirit of the rules and is not allowed.
10. Adding new features to existing projects is allowed. Judges will only consider new functionality introduced or new features added during the hackathon in determining the winners.
11. Teams must stop hacking once the time is up. However, teams are allowed to debug and make small fixes to their programs after time is up. For example, if during the demo your hack you find a bug that breaks your application and the fix is only a few lines of code, it's okay to fix that. Making large changes or adding new features is not allowed.
12. Participants who asked for a travel reimbursement need to post a project before the deadline in order to get the reimbursement. The Organiser can extend under special circumstances this deadline in order to let a Participant submit their project.
13. Projects that violate the Code of Conduct are not allowed (clause 3).
14. Teams can be disqualified from the competition at the Organisers' discretion. Reasons might include but are not limited to breaking the Competition Rules, breaking the Code of Conduct, or other unsporting behaviour.

#### Demos

After hacking finishes, teams will show their projects to each other and to the judges.

You are strongly encouraged to present a demo of what you have built. Pitches or presentations are discouraged. You are not judged on the quality of your pitch or the quality of your idea. As you are judged on what you built, you'll only hurt yourself by not showing a demo.

You are encouraged to present what you have done even if your hack is broken or you weren’t able to finish. It's okay if you didn't finish your hack, that happens all the time! Completion is only one part of the judging criteria, so you might still do well. Also, demoing is not just about the competition. It's a chance to share with others what you learned and what you tried to build that's what hacking's all about! In the case that you don't have anything to demo, you can give a presentation about what you tried and what you learned. Hearing what other people learned is interesting and inspiring for other attendees.

#### Judging criteria

Teams will be judged on these four criteria. Judges will weigh the criteria equally. During judging, Participants should try to describe what they did for each criterion in their project.

* Technology: How technically impressive was the hack? Was the technical problem the team tackled difficult? Did it use a particularly clever technique or did it use many different components? Did the technology involved make you go "wow"?
* Design: Did the team put thought into the user experience? How well designed is the interface? For a website, this might be about how beautiful the CSS or graphics are. For a hardware project, it might be more about how good the human-computer interaction is (for example, is it easy to use or does it use a cool interface?).
* Completion: Does the hack work? Did the team achieve everything they wanted?
* Learning: Did the team stretch themselves? Did they try to learn something new? What kind of projects have they worked on before? If a team which always does virtual reality projects decides to switch up and try doing a mobile app instead, that exploration should be rewarded.

This criteria will guide judges but ultimately judges are free to make decisions based on their gut feeling of which projects are the most impressive and most deserving.

It's important to note that these judging criteria do not include:

* How good your code is. It doesn't matter if your code is messy, or not well commented, or uses inefficient algorithms. Hacking is about playing around, making mistakes, and learning new things. If your code isn't production ready, we're not going to mark you down.
* How well you pitch. Hacking is about building and learning, not about selling.
* How good the idea is. Again, hackathons aren't about coming up with innovative ideas. It's about building and learning.
* How well the project solves a problem. You can build something totally useless and as long as you're learning and having fun, that's a good hack! Sometimes a pointless project is one of the best hacks!

So don't worry about coming up with the next big idea or building the next social network. You'll have plenty of time for that outside the hackathon. Just focus on learning, having fun, and making new friends. At the end of the day the skills you learn and the friends you make might lead to the next big thing—but you don't have to do that to win a hackathon.

#### Travel reimbursement

If you have been elected to receive a travel reimbursement, we will contact you after the hackathon to send it. You will receive a maximum that has been specified on the email, based on current travelling prices and distances.

Requirements to receive travel reimbursement are the following.

* Received an email with travel reimbursement amount before the event.
* Travel reimbursement receipts submitted before the end of KTHack or before the date specified by the KTHack team.
* Project submitted to DevPost or to the specified platform before the due date and time.

#### Cheating

Any cheating allegations will be resolved according to KTHack cheating response procedure (clause 4).

#### Remember

The competition is just a part of the hackathon. To make the most out of the event, try something new, teach other people, and make new friends! Happy hacking from the KTHack team!

### 3.Code of Conduct

This is the Code of Conduct that we expect all KTHack participants to abide. This is a customised version of the Code of Conduct used at MLH member hackathons. If you have a suggestion for this code of conduct or a question about them, please let us know.

#### TL;DR

Be respectful. Harassment and abuse are never tolerated.

#### The Code of Conduct

At KTHAIS we believe that every participant has the right to hack in a safe and welcoming environment.

Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, social class, economic status, veteran status, sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. If what you’re doing is making someone feel uncomfortable, that counts as harassment and is enough reason to stop doing it.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors, judges, mentors, volunteers, organizers, and anyone else at the event are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, attendees should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material both in their hacks and during the event. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, KTHAIS may take any action it deems appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no eligibility for reimbursement or refund of any type.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact KTHAIS using the reporting procedures defined below.

Event organizers will be happy to help participants contact campus security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all hackathon venues, online interactions in relation to the event, hackathon-related social events, and on hackathon supplied transportation.

#### Reporting procedures

If you feel uncomfortable or think there may be a potential violation of the Code of Conduct, please report it immediately using one of the following methods. All reporters have the right to remain anonymous.

By sending us an email to [contact@kthack.com](mailto:contact@kthack.com), your report will be received by our organisers. If you want to remain anonymous please send us an email through an anonymous email service or create a temporary email account.

If you need to contact a team member directly, please contact one of our organisers below.

* Oriol Closa, @oriolclosa in Slack, [oriol@kthack.com](mailto:oriol@kthack.com).

KTHAIS reserves the right to revise, make exceptions to, or otherwise amend these policies in whole or in part.

### 4.Cheating reponse procedure

#### Procedure

The following is a guide of actions to be taken in the case of an accusation that a team cheated or otherwise violated the rules of competition.

Accusations of cheating may include but are not limited to the following.

* A team using somebody else's code.
* A team misrepresenting the work they did.
* A team having too many team members.
* A team using code that was written outside the event.

To determine the validity of cheating instances KTHAIS defers to the rules addressed in clause 2.

#### Accusation

If you suspect cheating, please get in touch with the organisers of the event. If you are still at the event, please talk to a KTHack organizer. If it is after the event, please email [contact@kthack.com](mailto:contact@kthack.com).

#### Document the report

The following steps are to be followed by KTHAIS.

Try to get as much of the allegation in written form by the reporter. If you cannot, transcribe it yourself as it was told to you.

The important information to gather include the following.

* Identifying information (name, email, phone, etc.) of the reporter.
* Identifying information (name, email, phone, etc.) of the participant/team accused of cheating.
* Reason the reporter suspects cheating.
* Other people suspected to be involved in the cheating.
* Other witnesses/people who suspect the cheating.
* Any relevant URLs (for example GitHub repositories or DevPost pages).

KTHack organisers will then investigate the allegation by reviewing public materials about the hack, including project repositories, project submissions and anything else available to them.

#### Response

##### A.Cheating did not occur

If KTHAIS determines cheating did not occur, they will compile a report and inform the reporter.

##### B.Other outcomes

If KTHAIS is unable to determine that cheating did not occur based on publicly available resources, organizers will then communicate with the alleged cheater. Informing them of what has been reported about them. Allow the alleged cheater to give their side of the story to the staff. After this point, if the report stands, let the alleged cheater know what actions will be taken against them.

##### Actions that organisers will consider when dealing with alleged cheating offenders

The following actions will be considered.

* Warning the cheater to cease their behavior and that any further reports will result in sanctions.
* Not allowing the participants to demo.
* Not allowing the participants to win prizes.
* Revocation of prizes and recognitions.
* Banning the participants from future events (either indefinitely or for a certain time period).
* Publishing an account of the cheating.

Depending on the cheating allegation, KTHAIS may decide to make one or more public announcements. If necessary, this will be done with a short announcement. No one other than KTHack directors should make any announcements.

If some attendees were angered by the cheating, it is best to apologise to them that the cheating occurred to begin with.
